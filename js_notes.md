Correct Answer:

None of above.
Explanation:
Option 1 : console.log(2) :
This statement logs the number 2 to the console. It does not cause any runtime error.

Option 2 : console.log(4 / 0) :
Output: Infinity
Explanation: Dividing by zero in JavaScript results in Infinity. This is not a runtime error, but a special numeric value.

Option 3 : console.log('9' * 3) :
Output: 27
Explanation: JavaScript converts the string '9' to a number and performs the multiplication. The result is 27. This does not cause any runtime error.


Correct Answer(s):

console.log("5 5");
console.log(5, 5);
Explanation:
 The console.log("5 5"); statement prints the string 5 5, and
 the console.log(5, 5); statement prints the numbers 5 and 5 separated by a space, which is the default separator when multiple arguments are passed to console.log.



Correct Answer(s):

let a = 1;
let b = '1';
let c = "1";
let d = true;
Explanation:
In JavaScript, all the options provided (a = 1;, b = '1';, c = "1";, d = true;) are syntactically correct:

let a = 1; initializes variable a with the number 1.
let b = '1'; initializes variable b with the string '1'.
let c = "1"; initializes variable c with the string "1".
let d = true; initializes variable d with the boolean value tru


Correct Answer:

55.5688
Explanation:
In JavaScript, the + operator performs string concatenation when one of the operands is a string. Here, x is a string and y is a number. Therefore, x + y results in the string "55.5688".

Correct Answer:

number
number
string
Explanation:
let x = 1; assigns the value 1 to x, which is a number.

let y = 2.6; assigns the value 2.6 to y, which is also a number.

let z = "2 + 3i"; assigns the string "2 + 3i" to z.

Correct Answer:

8
512
56
Explanation:
x / y: JavaScript converts x from a string to a number for the division operation, resulting in 64 / 8 which is 8.

x * y: JavaScript converts x from a string to a number for the multiplication operation, resulting in 64 * 8 which is 512.

x - y: JavaScript converts x from a string to a number for the subtraction operation, resulting in 64 - 8 which is 56.

Correct Answer:

false
Explanation:
In JavaScript, boolean expressions evaluate to either true or false. The expression 10 == 9 evaluates to false because 10 is not equal to 9.



number
number
Explanation:
In JavaScript, there is no strict differentiation between integer and numeric types like in some other programming languages. All numbers, whether integers or floating-point, are of type number

Correct Answer:

For all cases, x is true.
Explanation:
This option is correct because the Boolean function in JavaScript converts any non-empty string or non-zero number to true. Since "true", "False", and 300 are all truthy values, Boolean will return true for these, and the direct assignment let x = true; makes x true in the fourth snippet.
